QUESTIONS

1. What is a qubit?

2. Describe the qubit's Hilbert space (the structure of the state vector, i.e. the "wavefunction"). How many (physically relevant) degrees of freedom does the qubit's state have?

3. Consider the so-called Pauli matrices \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z. For a spin-1/2 system, find the quantum states which are the eigenstates of these Pauli matrices. What is the physical meaning of such quantum states (google it)? 

4. To describe the physical behaviour of the qubit, one needs to give the Hamiltonian for it. What would be the general form of such a Hamiltonian? How many degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) does it have? How to express it with the Pauli matrices?

5. Consider the hermitian operator \vec{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma}\equivn_x\sigma_x+n_y\sigma_y+n_z\sigma_z, for n^2_x+n^2_y+n^2_z=1. What are the eigenvalues of such a combination? What are the eigenstates? How to use these eigenstates to recover the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian parametrized as in the previous exercize?

6. Consider a unitary transformation of a qubit generated by the \sigma_z, \sigma_y Pauli matrices, i.e. \exp(i\phi\sigma_z) and \exp(i\theta\sigma_y). What do they do to an arbitrary qubit state?

7. To properly represent the d.o.f. that the qubit has, one needs to come up with a smart parametrization of the states. Google the Bloch sphere parametrization: how does it work? How to understand it as a sequence of unitary rotations from the previous question, applied to a \sigma_z-polarized state?

8. Interprete the unit vector \vec{n} from p.5, as a vector on a sphere with coordinates \theta,\phi. How to understand the Bloch sphere states in terms of the eigenstates of the matrix \vec{n}\cdot\vec{sigma}?


HINTS

1. A two-level quantum system which evolves under external control. (What does this mean? Possible examples?)

2a. Hilbert space is the vector space where the states of the system live. The only thing you need is to determine its dimensionality; whether it's a complex or a real vector space; and what's the physical interpretation of its basis vectors (as quantum states).
2b. For the degrees of freedom, take into account the normalization condition and the fact that the overall phase is physically irrelevant.

3. To find the eigensystem of a Pauli matrix, solve the characteristic equation. Is there a faster way to do it? (think of the following properties: \sigma^2_\alpha=1, \tr \sigma_\alpha=0)

4a. The Hamiltonian for a quantum system with d-dimensional Hilbert space is a d x d Hermitian matrix. What would be the general form of such a matrix in this case?
4b. Express the general Hamiltonian as a linear combination of the three Pauli matrices, and the fourth matrix, namely the identity.

5. To find the eigenvalues of \vec{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma}, consider the identity (\vec{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma})^2=1, \tr\vec{n}\cdot\vec{\sigma}=0. For the eigenstates, solve the characteristic equation. Try to simplify your answers as much as possible, so that they take the neat form.

6. To give a nice expression for the exponential, consider the series for the exponential function, and the property \sigma^2_\alpha=1. You can use the outcome to evaluate the action on the qubit state.

7. Try \exp(i\theta\sigma_y)\exp(i\phi\sigma_z) applied to a \sigma_z-polarized state. How to relate the answer to the expression that you found in the literature?

8. For this, try to massage the answer for the eigenstates from p.5, in terms of the spherical coordinates of \vec{n}, \theta and \phi.
